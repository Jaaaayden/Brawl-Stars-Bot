# Brawl Stars Bot
First bot I've ever developed. Working on adding auto-balancing teams for fairer tournaments. Brawlers list also needs to be adjusted to update automatically with new releases.

# Usage
```
/profile  Pulls player data on total trophies, wins & more
/nuzlocke  Picks n brawlers randomly (of those that the user has) and displays them
/link  Connects player tag to name to make accessing data easier
```

# Credits
This project was developed using discord.py API and brawling (async wrapper for the Brawl Stars API)
